# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
Hello to whoever's reading this, this is my first time using Github and it's a little confusing getting into it. I'm officially starting my cybersecurity journey today and I'm going to remain consistent. In the future I'd love to get projects done and help others with theirs. I love learning about hacking and it's really satisfying to build knowledge on sophisticated areas of cybersecurity.
